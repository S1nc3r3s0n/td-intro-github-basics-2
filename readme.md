#Version Control System
Version control System is a management tool used by developers to track their work such that changes made in the course of the project can be compared to previous versions and corrected in case there is an error. It makes the work easier as it helps to work faster without giving much stress. Version control helps to protect source code from catastrophic conditions and human errors. Version Control is flexible and can be made suitable for different work flows. It aids the activities of a team of developers to reduce the issue of incompatibility and misunderstanding by allowing them keep track of different aspects of their project. In summary, for an efficient, risk-controlled, fast and organized project, the use of a version control system is essential
#GIT
GIT is a free open source version control system. It is the commonest and most used version control. Although, initial cloning is a slower process, one of the numerous advantages of GIT is that it allows subsequent actions to be faster. Also, GIT allows efficiency in that only few lines of coding is needed and it ensures that developers have their code repository locally. It makes it easy to merge, branch and rewrite history.
#To commit a project to git hub repository
After the code of a project has been successfully done, to commit a project to git hub repository, the following must be done:
 GIT will be initialized (“git init”)
The programming language will be added (“git add .”)
The project is then committed (first commit)
Project main command is given and then branched
The origin is remotely added
The project is then finally pushed to git repository
